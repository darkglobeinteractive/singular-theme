Singular Theme Installation Notes
===================================

mmenu (v.7.2.2)
-----------------------------------
Based-on the documentation (https://mmenujs.com/documentation/) as of August 6, 2019, we are using mmenu Version 7 here due to Version 8 only supporting ES6 compliant browsers. This would not be fully supportive of IE 10 and 11. As much as I would like to stop considering those browsers, this theme is used for freelance development, so it's something I don't want to have to "fix" down the road.

Add Main Menu
